## 🚀 Technologies Used

This project was developed to master key concepts required for modern frontend frameworks:

* **HTML5 (Semantic):** Structured the component layout.
* **CSS3 (Grid & Flexbox):** Utilizes **CSS Grid** for the main 2D calculator layout and **Flexbox** for internal element alignment (e.g., within the display output).
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):**
    * **Classes:** Structured the entire calculator logic using an ES6 `class` for object-oriented state management.
    * **Arrow Functions & `const`/`let`:** Used modern, block-scoped syntax for clean, predictable code.
    * **State Management:** Managed calculator memory (current/previous operands, operation) internally within the class instance.

## ✨ Features

* Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /).
* Clear (AC) and Delete (DEL) functionality.
* Handles floating-point numbers (decimals).
* Responsive layout built with pure CSS Grid.
